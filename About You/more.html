    <h1>Classes I've taken prior</h1>
    <p class="center">
        I've taken quite a handful of courses already, starting in 2018 as part of dual enrollment. I already have my
        associates in general studies but I am looking to specify in the field of CIS with a certificate.
    </p>

    <h1>Specific Classes </h1>
    <p class="center">I have already taken quite a lot of courses, but the ones I really remeber are Math-128,
        PSY-110/285, and CIS-120. Math for just being something I greatly struggled with, Psy for being something I have
        an interest in learning about but no interesting in working in, and CIS for giving me some sort of direction to
        work towards.
